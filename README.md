# ISonata

This repository provides a modular interface for a document-store Mochi service.
This interface is mapped to that of [Sonata](https://github.com/mochi-hpc/mochi-sonata)
and is meant to help Sonata users switch to [Yokan](https://github.com/mochi-hpc/mochi-yokan),
as Sonata is deprecated and Yokan offers a document-store interface.
If you are not a Sonata user in the first place, you have no reason to use ISonata.
If you are a Sonata user, we still highly recomment that you make the transition directly
to Yokan rather than rely on ISonata.
